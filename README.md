## About me:
I'm a fullstack developer from :argentina: Argentina :argentina: currently working at [@SantexGroup](https://github.com/SantexGroup).  
I'm a highly enthusiastic developer, I love to code and explore new ideas. In my free time I like to swim and go on walks.  
I have a great interest in ML, cellular automatas, emerging behaviors, and creative coding.

## Fun fact:
  - I am a 🐶 dogs 🐶 person. (I would love to have one, but my apartment contract prohibits it)
  - My favorite programming language is 🦀 Rust 🦀.
  - I am an NVIM user. (you can find all my configurations in my dotfiles repo)
  - I am obsessed whit trying note-taking apps.
  - I am currently in a crisis about my favorite hot beverage, between 🧉 MATE 🧉 or ☕ COFFEE ☕.
